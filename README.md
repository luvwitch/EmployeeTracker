## Usage

Upon downloading the necessary files, within the console run the command: 
```bash
npm i
```
This will begin installing the necessary extra packages needed to run the application. They are already defined within the package.json so git will recognize what needs to be specifically installed, saving the user time it would take to install each package individually.

Using the mysql workbench, import the employeetrack and seeds files and run them to populate your database.

The server will be started by using the following command:

```bash
node company.js
```
Once the server is connected to the database, the console can be used to view, add, and update based on the users selections!
